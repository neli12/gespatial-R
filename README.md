# Geospatial-R
You can find here some R script for working with geospatial data. Basically, some geoprocesing such as cropping, merging, etc.
- `script_crop_extract`: crop and extract values of a raster.
- `script_simulations_geo`: make Conditional Gaussian simulation of kriging estimates as a way to estimate uncertainty.
